general:
 * Document that all measures are two-point functions.
 * Document distinction between testbed and optimizer.
 * Document that trajectory evaluations are in the "pose and tangent pose" space.
 * Make class aliases for "time", "index", "real" and other simple classes?

research:
 *** Create leastSquares components that optimize initial state.
 *** Complete work on linearKalman components.
 * Topics for publication:
   * Measurement graphs as an alternative to pose graphs.

testComponent:
 * Apply unit tests to all components to check interfaces and exception handling
 * Characterize measures
   * Value when given ground truth
   * Granularity / dilution of precision
   * Monotonicity
   * Bias / distance to nearest local minimum
   * Sensitivity to perturbation of initial tangent pose

demonstration:
 *** Use start time referenceDate = datestr(now,30)?
 *** Access camera and inertial sensor on a MacBook.
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes.
 * Perform trade studies: GPS quality, IMU quality, camera FOV, camera FPS, image resolution, limited computation

optimizer:
 *** Wrap "objective" so that all measures are refreshed simultaneously (make GA properties private again)
 *** Choose number of blocks dynamically based on data.
 * Create linkage-based GA crossover function.

dynamicModel:
 *** Add prior cost of initial pose and configure initial pose in each component
 *** Specify outputs of evaluate() using string like 'pqrs'

measure:
 * Use SURF instead of SIFT.
 * Implement SURF as a feature-matching option in opticalFlowOpenCV.
 * Does GPLv2 license for SBA code allow linking?
 * Add an example of a GPS measure (maybe in measureStub).
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent information bits, total information bits)
 * Fix axis ordering bug in pointBasedMeasure
 * In pointBasedMeasure, cache results of finding keypoints for each image.
 * In opticalFlowOpenCV, cache results of finding cvGoodFeaturesToTrack.

dataContainer:
 *** Make interface compatible with AFRL ANTBED.
 * Find a way to distinguish between multiple sensors that derive from the same class.
   * Improve scheme for matching measures to sensor data.
   * listSensors() should return a list of strings identifying sensors?
 * Split globalSatData into a measure and a reference trajectory simulator?
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.
 * Make a container that has all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
 * Inertial sensor interface should specify its error characteristics?
 * Interfacing with Paul Metzger's simulator?

cameraArray:
 * Check fisheye projection and inverseProjection equations at image center.
 * Should masking be separate from projection?
