general:
 * Test mainDisplay to ensure inputs can be either row or column vectors.
 * Separate dataContainer stuff from the trajectory optimization manager.
 * Make class aliases for "time", "index", "real" and other simple classes?
 * Replace zero-based indices with non-zero-bases indices when possible.
 * Add mlint testing requirement in how to make a component wiki.
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Clarify time system by introducing t0 reference?
 * Implement measure/sensor compatibility checking.
 * Formally ask UCF to fix TODO statements in their code.
 * Write unit tests to check interfaces and exception handling.

demonstration:
 *** Design tabletop hardware setup
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes
 * Perform trade studies: GPS quality, IMU quality, camera FOV, camera FPS, image resolution, limited computation

optimizer:
 * Move most of tommas into the optimizer.
 * Move choice of tmin from tommasConfig to the optimizer?
 * Hide the creation of a plain "objective" behind the optimizer interface.
 * Wrap the "objective" so that optimizer never sees trajectories directly?
 * Have Rob create linkage-based GA crossover function.

dataContainer:
 *** Support projection and inverseProjection for Gantry camera data.
 * Make stub that contains all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * Find a way to distinguish between multiple sensors that derive from the same class.
 * Coordinate with Jimmy Touma for AFRL data.
 * Remove dependence on Symbolic Toolbox.
   * Convert thesis symbolic BodyPath and its derivative to char and talk to Seth Teller about saving/moving it.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
 * Interfacing with Paul Metzger's simulator?

dynamicModel:
 * Require [ta,tb] as inputs to the constructor?
 * Make dynamicModelStub a discrete LTI system defined by A,B,C,D.
 * Method to extend number of model parameters to cover a later time.
 * Dynamic model takes inputs pqa, deltat, and parameters?
 * Recompute trajectory only when parameters change.
 * Handle display of trajectories with infinite domain bounds.

measure:
 * Require [ta,tb] as inputs to the constructor?
 * Clarify throughout the documentation that all measures are two-point
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent information bits, total information bits)
 * Add accuracy tolerance input to computeEdgeCost?
 * Measure should advertise the type of sensor that it needs.
 * Make getEdges list nodes in a interval restricted by upper AND lower indices.
 * Add SIFT or SURF visual measure.
 * Speed up optical flow.
 * Add an example of a GPS measure or fold into measureStub.
  
cameraArray:
 * Add function getImageSize().
 * Should masking be sepate from projection?
