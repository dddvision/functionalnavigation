general:
 * Write Q2 report including Tony's dynamic model code and Avinash's GPS dataset
 * Schedule meeting with AFRL.
 * Coordinate with Prince to introduce caching in visual measures.
 * Send commit emails to a google group, and invite UCF students to join.
 * Create repository for UCF to place visual measures with license issues.
 * Write unit tests to check interfaces and exception handling.
 * Make class aliases for "time", "index", "real" and other simple classes?
 * Write unit tests to check interfaces and exception handling.
 * Use start time referenceDate = datestr(now,30)?
 * Simplify display technique to handle large domains, including tb=inf.

demonstration:
 *** Design tabletop hardware setup
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes
 * Perform trade studies: GPS quality, IMU quality, camera FOV, camera FPS, image resolution, limited computation

optimizer:
 * Wrap the "objective" so that optimizer never sees trajectories directly?
 * Have Rob create linkage-based GA crossover function.

dynamicModel:
 * Make dynamicModelStub a discrete LTI system defined by A,B,C,D.
 * Specify evaluate outputs using string like 'pqrs'?

measure:
 * Implement measure/sensor compatibility checking in measure configuration.
 * Use SURF instead of SIFT.
 * Avoid platform specific binaries whenever possible.
 * Require [ta,tb] as inputs to the constructor?
 * Clarify throughout the documentation that all measures are two-point.
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent information bits, total information bits)
 * Add an example of a GPS measure (maybe in measureStub).

dataContainer:
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.
 * listSensors() should return a list of strings identifying sensors?
 * Make stub that contains all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * Find a way to distinguish between multiple sensors that derive from the same class.
 * Coordinate with Jimmy Touma for AFRL data.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
 * Inertial sensor interface should specify its error characteristics?
 * Interfacing with Paul Metzger's simulator?
  
cameraArray:
 * Should masking be sepate from projection?

main application:
 * Test mainDisplay to ensure inputs can be either row or column vectors.

research:
 * Olsen: Pose graphs
 * review other code in projects/1490/software
 * elements of statistical learning
 * Cramer-Rao: cov(your estimator)>=inv(information)
