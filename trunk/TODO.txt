DynamicModel:
 * Bug: Why does BrownianPlanar produce straight paths?

Optimizer:
 *** Should accept a vector of DynamicModel names to potentially use.

 *** Review UCF's latest PointBasedMeasure submission (should use SURF instead of SIFT).
 *** Consider whether findEdges needs trajectory input to compute intercepts for path planning applications.
 * Split GlobalSatData into a measure and a reference trajectory simulator.
 * Implement SURF as a feature-matching option in OpticalFlowOpenCV.
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent bits, total bits)
 * Fix axis ordering bug in PointBasedMeasure
 * In PointBasedMeasure, cache results of finding keypoints for each image.
 * In OpticalFlowOpenCV, cache results of finding cvGoodFeaturesToTrack.

DataContainer:
 *** Develop stateless API compatible with AFRL ANTBED.
 * Consider use of netcdf format for ANTBED data.
 * Link into RAWSEEDS data (ask developers about value of standardized API).
 * Develop configuration tool that assists the user in selecting data sources.
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
