general:
 * Make class aliases for "time", "index", "real" and other simple classes?
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.
 * Write unit tests to check interfaces and exception handling.

policy clarifications:
 * Packages should not assume that they are in the components directory.
 * Configuration file naming policy, especially for dataContainer.
 * Components must pass mlint test or contain a comment at each line explaining why not.
 * Publicise the programming guidelines set up for CMARS.
 * Use fprintf instead of disp() or warning().
 * Component bugs
   * Should not be submitted to the functionalnavigation issue tracker.
   * Should be noted with TODO statements within code.

demonstration:
 *** Design tabletop hardware setup
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes
 * Perform trade studies: GPS quality, IMU quality, camera FOV, camera FPS, image resolution, limited computation

optimizer:
 *** Objective inherits measure and dynamicModel?
 * Move most of tommas into the optimizer.
 * Move choice of tmin from tommasConfig to the optimizer?
 * Hide the creation of a plain "objective" behind the optimizer interface.
 * Wrap the "objective" so that optimizer never sees trajectories directly?
 * Have Rob create linkage-based GA crossover function.

dynamicModel:
 * Require [ta,tb] as inputs to the constructor?
 * Make dynamicModelStub a discrete LTI system defined by A,B,C,D.
 * Method to extend number of model parameters to cover a later time.
 * Dynamic model takes inputs pqa, deltat, and parameters?
 * Recompute trajectory only when parameters change.
 * Handle display of trajectories with infinite domain bounds.
 * Specify evaluate outputs using string like 'pqrs'?

measure:
 * Implement measure/sensor compatibility checking in measure configuration.
 * Add SIFT or SURF visual measure.
 * Speed up optical flow.
 * Require [ta,tb] as inputs to the constructor?
 * Clarify throughout the documentation that all measures are two-point.
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent information bits, total information bits)
 * Add accuracy tolerance (or computational budget) input to computeEdgeCost?
 * Add an example of a GPS measure (maybe in measureStub).

dataContainer:
 * listSensors() should return a list of strings identifying sensors?
 * Make stub that contains all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * Find a way to distinguish between multiple sensors that derive from the same class.
 * Coordinate with Jimmy Touma for AFRL data.
 * Remove dependence on Symbolic Toolbox.
   * Convert thesis symbolic BodyPath and its derivative to char and talk to Seth Teller about saving/moving it.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
 * Inertial sensor interface should specify its error characteristics?
 * Interfacing with Paul Metzger's simulator?
  
cameraArray:
 * Should masking be sepate from projection?

main application:
 * Test mainDisplay to ensure inputs can be either row or column vectors.
