general:
 * Incorporate Google C++ Style Guidelines throughout the code.
 * Explicitly use assert instead of exceptions in C++?
 * Document that all measures are two-point functions.
 * Document that trajectory evaluations are in the "pose and tangent pose" space.
 * Document that we are using log likelihood because it is summative instead of multiplicative.
 * Making class aliases for "Time", "NodeIndex", "Pair" (for edges) and other simple classes.

testbed:
 *** Document distinction between testbed and Optimizer.
 * Create unit tests for all framework classes to check interfaces and exception handling.
   * Make a container that has all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * Create advanced unit tests to characterize measures
   * Cost when given ground truth
   * Granularity / dilution of precision
   * Monotonicity
   * Bias / distance to nearest local minimum
   * Sensitivity to perturbation of initial tangent pose

demonstration:
 *** Create inertial/visual DataContainer for MacBook demo.
 *** Write code for low level access to iSight camera.
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes.
 * Perform trade studies: GPS quality, IMU quality, camera FOV, camera FPS, image resolution, limited computation

Optimizer:
 * Create linkage-based GA crossover function.

DynamicModel:
 * Add functions for parameter generation and trajectory extension (then take MultiMeasure out of Objective).

Measure:
 *** Review UCF's latest PointBasedMeasure submission (should use SURF instead of SIFT).
 * Split GlobalSatData into a measure and a reference trajectory simulator.
 * Implement SURF as a feature-matching option in OpticalFlowOpenCV.
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent bits, total bits)
 * Fix axis ordering bug in PointBasedMeasure
 * In PointBasedMeasure, cache results of finding keypoints for each image.
 * In OpticalFlowOpenCV, cache results of finding cvGoodFeaturesToTrack.

DataContainer:
 *** Develop stateless API compatible with AFRL ANTBED.
 * Develop configuration tool that assists the user in selecting data sources.
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
 * Inertial sensor interface should specify its error characteristics?

CameraArray:
 * Check fisheye projection and inverseProjection equations at image center.
 * Should masking be separate from projection?
