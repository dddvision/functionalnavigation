Demonstration:
 * Demonstrate variable computation concept
 * Re-interpretation of old data through re-evaluation of Measures
 * Show that measurement graphs are a superclass of pose graphs
 * Provide textual descriptions of use cases on the Wiki
   * TOMMAS is a Reference Implementation (RI)
   * Describe the distinction between testbed and Optimizer
 * Describe how to perform trade studies
   * loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes
   * computation limitations
   * GPS quality
   * IMU quality
   * camera FOV
   * camera FPS
   * image resolution

Documentation:
 * Present latest material on the whole framework
 * Disseminate to people listed in the correspondence directory
 * Complete minimal set of dOxygen comments
 * Elaborate on component descriptions
 * Visual Measures must take into account the camera offset and projection function
 * Code must compile and run on both Windows and Linux unless the user's environment is not capable
 * Write class level comments for all classes
 * Incorporate Google C++ Style Guidelines throughout the code
 * Update "download components" links, point to another wiki page that links to downloads and UCF code
 * Unify notation through paper, wiki, ppt, and code involving node indices and block indices (j or n)
 * Assert is not allowed in C++, use exceptions instead
 * The measurement cost functional evaluates trajectories over an interval defined by two points
 * Image masking is incorporated into the camera projection, most easily queried by its inverse
 * Add a glossary page
