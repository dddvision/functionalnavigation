general:
 * Create powerpoint for quarterly review (internal and external).
 * Schedule meeting with AFRL.
 * Write unit tests to check interfaces and exception handling.
 * Make class aliases for "time", "index", "real" and other simple classes?
 * Use start time referenceDate = datestr(now,30)?
 * Simplify display technique for speed given large domains, including tb=inf.

research:
 * Topics for publication:
   * Measurement graphs as an alternative to pose graphs.
 * Review standards:
   * Sandia Modular Architecture for Robotics and Teleoperation
   * JAUGS modular architecture 
 * Olsen: Pose graphs
 * review other code in projects/1490/software
 * elements of statistical learning
 * Cramer-Rao: cov(your estimator)>=inv(information)
 * Anil Rao & Dave Benson: Gauss Pseudospectral Method (GPM)
 * Natalia Hernandez Gardiol @ CSAIL:
 * Bar-Shalom: Multitarget Multisensor tracking
 * Adam Klivans: learning decision trees over binary inputs
 * Kalai: learning halfspaces
 * Titterton, D. H. and Weston, J. L. Strapdown Inertial Navigation Technology. IEE, page 254, 2004.

demonstration:
 * Access camera and inertial sensor on a MacBook.
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes.
 * Perform trade studies: GPS quality, IMU quality, camera FOV, camera FPS, image resolution, limited computation

optimizer:
 *** Must wrap "objective" so that all measures are refreshed simultaneously.
 * Have Rob create linkage-based GA crossover function.

trajectory:
 *** Specify evaluate outputs using string like 'pqrs'?
 * Dodument that evaluations are in the "pose and tangent pose" space.

measure:
 * Check rotation equation in opticalFlowOpenCV/generateFlowSparse
 * Use SURF instead of SIFT.
 * Add an example of a GPS measure (maybe in measureStub).
 * Should findEdges be restricted to return up to a maximum number of edges?
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent information bits, total information bits)
 * Document that all measures are two-point functions.
 * Require [ta,tb] as inputs to the constructor?
 * In pointBasedMeasure, cache results of finding keypoints for each image.
 * Implement measure/sensor compatibility checking in measure configuration.

dataContainer:
 * Needs to be a singleton class!
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.
 * listSensors() should return a list of strings identifying sensors?
 * Make stub that contains all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * Find a way to distinguish between multiple sensors that derive from the same class.
 * Coordinate with Jimmy Touma for AFRL data.
 * VAMAV OpenSceneGraph simulator?
 * Packaging King Air flight?
 * Inertial sensor interface should specify its error characteristics?
 * Interfacing with Paul Metzger's simulator?
  
cameraArray:
 * Should masking be sepate from projection?

main application:
 * Test mainDisplay to ensure inputs can be either row or column vectors.
