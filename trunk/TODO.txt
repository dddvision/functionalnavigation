General:
 *** Transfer most TODO items to the main repository issue tracker.
 *** BUG: Rename Edge class so that it doesn't clobber MATLAB's edge function.
 *** Add getDescription() or description() function to all framework classes.
 * Is there a better way to pass classes that are structs from C++ to MATLAB?
 * Make policy decisions regarding copy constructors for each class.
 * Incorporate Google C++ Style Guidelines throughout the code.
 * Disseminate to people listed in 1490/correspondence directory.

Testbed:
 * Create unit tests for all framework classes to check interfaces and exception handling.
   * Make a container that has all sensors and type checks its inputs.
 * Create advanced unit tests to characterize measures.
   * Cost when given ground truth
   * Granularity / dilution of precision
   * Monotonicity
   * Bias / distance to nearest local minimum
   * Sensitivity to perturbation of initial tangent pose

Demo:
 *** Complete the inertial/visual data container for MacBook.
 *** BUG: Why are trajectories not displayed on Omar's machine?
 * Demonstrate GPS/IMU fused in loose, tight, and ultra-tight modes.

DynamicModel:
 * Bug: Why does BrownianPlanar produce straight paths?

Optimizer:
 * Create linkage-based GA crossover function.
 * Implement Pose Graph optimization.
 * Consider making OptimizerBridge (difficult long-term objective).

Objective:
 *** Consider getting rid of objective.
   * Try to move functionality into other classes?
   * Replace with new MultiMeasure class?

Measure:
 *** Review UCF's latest PointBasedMeasure submission (should use SURF instead of SIFT).
 *** Split GlobalSatData into a GPS simulator that uses data set refrences, and a seperate reference trajectory simulator.
 * Consider how intervals should be handled
   * Should findEdges return an interval index?
   * Should findEdges receive a trajectory input to compute intercepts for path planning applications?
   * Should [ta,tb]=[-inf,inf] be a valid interval?
 * Implement SURF as a feature-matching option in OpticalFlowOpenCV.
 * In PointBasedMeasure, cache results of finding keypoints for each image.
 * In OpticalFlowOpenCV, cache results of finding cvGoodFeaturesToTrack.
 * Should cost be provided in two parts related to Shannon information? (inconsistent bits, total bits)

DataContainer:
 *** Inertial sensor interfaces should specify their error characteristics.
 *** Develop configuration tool that assists the user in selecting data sources.
 *** Develop stateless API compatible with AFRL ANTBED.
 *** Create arbitrary scene simulator (VAMAV OpenSceneGraph?).
 * Consider use of netcdf format for ANTBED data.
 * Link into RAWSEEDS data (ask developers about value of standardized API).
 * Add rangefinder class that could also represent bearing-only tracker output.
 * Add SICK laser scanner interface for legacy purposes.

CameraArray:
 *** BUG: Check fisheye projection and inverseProjection equations at image center.
 *** Write to VLC about choosing video resolution for iSight camera.
 * Should masking be separate from projection?

Documentation (mostly on wiki):
 * Distinction between testbed and Optimizer.
 * Unify notation through paper, wiki, ppt, and code involving node indices and block indices (j or n).
 * Assert is not allowed in C++.
 * All measures are functionals that evaluate trajectories over an interval defined by two points.
 * Trajectory evaluations are in the "pose and tangent pose" space.
 * Show how to perform trade studies
   * GPS quality
   * IMU quality
   * camera FOV
   * camera FPS
   * image resolution
   * limited computation
 * Glossary
   * dynamic model
