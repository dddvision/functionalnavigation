To try out the framework in MATLAB, download the source code and run the script {{{demo.m}}}. There is also a C++ framework, but it lacks demonstration components.

You will need MATLAB {{{R2009a}}} or later, and in order to make full use of the current version, you will also need the {{{Image Processing Toolbox}}} and the {{{Genetic Algorithm and Direct Search (GADS) Toolbox}}}.  

=== Next Steps ===

The framework comes with a few default examples of components that can be selected by editing DemoConfig.m. In addition, you can [http://code.google.com/p/functionalnavigation/downloads/list download components] created by others to demonstrate more system configurations.
